## Overview

**Vibebox** is a web platform built for music enthusiasts. It allows users to **share their Spotify playlists**, **discover new artists**, and **promote emerging talents**.

Designed as a musical community space, Vibebox was born from the desire to combine two passions: **web development** and **music**. This project was created as part of my **RNCP Level 5 professional certification**, but more importantly, it's a personal project that means a lot to me.

Join the community, share your vibes, and feel the rhythm together!
